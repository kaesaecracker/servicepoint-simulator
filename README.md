# servicepoint-simulator

An emulator for the CCCB airport display. 

![example render](example_render.png)

In CCCB, there is a big LED matrix screen you can send images to via UDP. 
This project aims to build a working an application that can receive packages in the same binary format and display the contents to the user.

Use cases:
- getting error messages for invalid packages
- test your project when outside CCCB
- test your project while other people are using the display

Uses the [servicepoint](https://github.com/cccb/servicepoint) library for reading the packets.
The screenshot above shows the output of two example projects running in parallel (game_of_life and random_brightness).

## Running

With nix flakes: `nix run github:kaesaecracker/servicepoint-simulator`

Without nix: check out this repository and use `cargo run --release`.

## Command line arguments

The application binds to `0.0.0.0:2342` by default (`./servicepoint-simulator --bind host:port` to change this).

See [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/) to configure logging.

Because this program renders to an RGB pixel buffer, you can enjoy the following additional features not available on the real display:

- enable or disable the empty space between tile rows (`./servicepoint-simulator --spacers` to enable)
- render pixels in red, green, blue or a combination of the three (`./servicepoint-simulator -rgb` for white pixels)
